In Java, a "bean" typically refers to a JavaBean, which is a class that follows specific conventions. These conventions enable the bean to be easily used in various frameworks and tools. Here are the key characteristics of a JavaBean:
Public No-Argument Constructor:
.

It must have a public constructor that takes no arguments. This allows frameworks to easily create instances of the bean.
Private Instance Variables:
.

Instance variables should be private to ensure encapsulation.
Public Getter and Setter Methods:
.

Access to the bean's properties is provided through public getter and setter methods. For example, a property named name would have a getName() method for retrieval and a setName(String name) method for modification. Boolean properties often use is instead of get (e.g., isAvailable()).
Serializable:
.

The class should implement the java.io.Serializable interface. This allows the bean's state to be saved and restored, enabling features like persistence and session management.
Purpose of JavaBeans:
Reusability: JavaBeans are designed to be reusable components.
Configuration: They can be easily configured through their properties.
Persistence: Their state can be saved and restored.
Framework Compatibility: JavaBeans are widely used in frameworks like Spring, where they are managed by the framework's container.
Spring Framework and @Bean:
In the Spring Framework, the @Bean annotation is used to declare that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring IoC container. This annotation is typically used in a configuration class annotated with @Configuration.
